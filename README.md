# Simple file synchonizer in Python

This project was a task made for a position evaluation.

# How to run

Run the python script(my version is 3.9.13), insert the arguments(make sure the directories are
correct or else it won´t accept it) and choose whether use hashing for comparing files(if not used, it will compare the entirety of the content).
To exit the program press Ctrl + C and press "y", it will exit after it finishes the operations.
The folder "original" contains some random files i used to test the functionalities, feel free to use it.
There´s some print i used for better following of the program which i commented since they´re not required to the task, uncomment it for better visualisation(after
the first syncronization, it might appear nothing on the screen if there´s no changes in both paths).
